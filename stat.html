        <p class="intro">Paths with the same text description are deemed to be similar in nature, thus are good to be inspected as a group.
            In the pie chart and bar chart below, we calculate the number of times every group of paths appeared in Google Map query results,
            as well as the corresponding mean and standard deviation of travel durations.</p>

        <p class="intro">Every point in the chart below represents the moment a path is suggested by Google Map, and the corresponding
            travel duration if we take this path. Different paths are distinguished by their coordinates. Paths with the same text description
            but are comprised of even slightly different (lat, lng) pairs are regarded as different paths. Points belong to the same
            path are connected with a poly-line. The BEST line records
            the lowest-duration option at every time step. Lines with 5 or less points are hidden for convenience.
            You may click the legend to hide/show the data.</p>

        <p class="intro">In this section, duration data are divided into several groups by the hour they are returned in the Google Map
            query. There should be 3 time slots for morning trips, and 4 for afternoon. For every slot, the in-slot average and standard
            deviation are calculated. Here we don't distinguish different paths. Data from all paths are used for calculation.</p>

        <p class="title">4. Time History</p>
        <p class="intro">The chart below keeps track of the mean and standard deviation of travel durations at each time step. A point in the
            chart at time t is derived based on durations of all paths returned at t. At the instant when only one path is returned, the
            standard deviation is omitted on purpose. The BEST line records the lowest-duration option for every timestamp.</p>
